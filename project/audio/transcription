Hi, I need to report an issue with my phone. I bought it recently, and it’s already cracked. I accidentally dropped it yesterday from maybe a foot or so, and the screen shattered. It’s really frustrating because the ads said it was supposed to be durable, like ‘built to last’ or something. But this? I mean, it was such a small drop.

I’ve had other phones that survived much worse... and this one was supposed to be stronger. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting this kind of problem. I’m really disappointed, and I need to know what can be done about it as it is a brand new phone within guarantee
